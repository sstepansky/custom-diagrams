## NOTES

1. The two folders correspond to the original Spanish version and an
   English translated version.

2. Under normal circumstances, the user-defined plots cannot be used to
   classify rocks (e.g. through the menu item *Data handling >
   Classify...*) (see `Diagrams/User/@README.txt`). In order to use this
   functionality without hacking the original GCDkit code, you must
   place a copy of the file inside the appropriate folder (e.g.
   `Diagrams/Classification/English/` or
   `Diagrams/Classification/Spanish/`). Note that by doing so, it will
   also be listed in the menu *Plots > Classification...*.

3. The fields of this diagram are left blank to avoid clutter. See the
   [original
   paper](https://sge.usal.es/archivos/geogacetas/geo63/geo63_24.pdf)
   for reference.
